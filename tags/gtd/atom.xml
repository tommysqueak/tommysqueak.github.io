    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I started this review process back in September 2011, eager to find the perfect GTD app for myself. I was looking forward to whizzing through the reviews, to find a winning app that would meet my needs set out in the <a title="GTD App Review – Who and What" href="http://tomphilip.me/index.php/gtd-app-review-introduction/">opening post</a>. I was writing the reviews, at times, twice a week. Then babies, work and disillusionment set in. The latter came about as it slowly dawned on me that there wouldn&rsquo;t be a clear winner, a perfect GTD for me (and others).</p>

<p>The conclusions I&rsquo;m about to draw, as I choose my &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; GTD system, will be a story of compromise. <strong>Will the app be, not perfect, but just good enough? Will missing features be made in the future? Many a &ldquo;it would be perfect if &hellip;&rdquo;.</strong></p>

<h2>Recap</h2>


<p><strong>The full story is in the <a title="GTD App Review – Who and What" href="http://tomphilip.me/index.php/gtd-app-review-introduction/">opening post</a></strong>. To find the perfect app, I came up with some basic criteria the app had to meet in order to be considered, this got the list down from over a hundred to a manageable 9 (10 originally, until I realised <a href="http://getitdoneapp.com/">Get It Done</a> didn&rsquo;t have a Mac app).</p>

<ul>
    <li>Multi Device – Mac, Android and Windows</li>
    <li>Quick</li>
    <li>Available Off-line with Cloud Syncing</li>
    <li>Beautiful/Great User Experience (UX)</li>
</ul>


<p>The following 9 shortlisted apps then got an in depth review:</p>

</ul>


<p>&hellip; and now here we are, about to find out  which I think is best and which will become my trusted system?</p>

<h2>Comparison Chart</h2>


<p>If you&rsquo;re after a quick comparison, here&rsquo;s <strong>how their features compared</strong>. The criteria is taken from my thoughts on what makes a great GTD app, outlined in the <a title="GTD App Review – Who and What" href="http://tomphilip.me/index.php/gtd-app-review-introduction/">introduction post</a>. I&rsquo;ve included some &lsquo;nice to have&rsquo; features that I discovered which I enjoyed and/or were useful.</p>

<h2>Honourable mentions</h2>


<p>These apps didn&rsquo;t get reviewed because they lacked some feature/s that made them unsuitable. I liked how they looked and their features, they show great promise:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.nirvanahq.com/">Nirvana</a> - Well thought out, great looking GTD web app.</li>
    <li><a href="http://asana.com/">Assana</a> - Good looking, collaborative task manager.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.smartytask.com/">Smarty Task</a> - Great looking GTD app with some smart filters.</li>
    <li><a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/">Omnifocus</a> - Users of these had great things to say about them but sadly Mac only.</li>
    <li><a href="http://get.wunderkit.com/">Wunderkit</a> - Wunderlists big brother, fantastic UI for collaborative task management.</li>
    <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anydo">Any.DO</a> - Slick Android app with intriguing gestures.</li>
</ul>


<h2>The Runners Up</h2>


<p>It was really hard to choose my apps to make up my trusted system. There wasn&rsquo;t a single one that looked like a clear winner. All of them had at least one thing wrong or missing. So it&rsquo;s not that the runners up are bad apps, it&rsquo;s just that the others were better, sometimes marginally.</p>

<h3>Wunderlist</h3>


<p><a href="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Wunderlist.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-465" title="Wunderlist" src="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Wunderlist.png" alt="" width="640" height="481" /></a></p>

<p><strong>I love Wunderlists simplicity and looks</strong> but the lack of tags or appearing in more than one list, means no contexts. Based on that alone it loses out. Although there might be reprieve for this, as I&rsquo;ve been using it for a while for my work tasks for <a title="Life Tuned - Music Memory Box" href="http://lifetuned.com">Life Tuned</a> and <a title="Pik Pak - Create, discover and share packing lists" href="http://pikpak.me">Pik Pak</a>, in a kind of personal Kanban. With its drag &lsquo;n&rsquo; drop task ordering (something surprisingly missing on most), it makes easy just-in-time ordering of the next tasks to do in a project, so it might remain as part of the system.</p>

<p>This is for you, if you after an app that has great looks, fantastic simple UX,  same experience across multiple platforms and are happy with basic task organisation.</p>

<h3>Conqu</h3>


<p><a href="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Conqu.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-847" title="Conqu" src="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Conqu.png" alt="Conqu" width="640" height="410" /></a></p>

<p><strong>The odd UI and it&rsquo;s clunky-ness is just something that would grate on me after a time</strong>, it bewildered me in the short time I used it. Plus missing features, like task recurrences (essential for doing stuff like monthly accounts) and Google calendar sync puts this one out of the running.</p>

<p>This is for you, if you after an app that looks good, supports many platforms (Playbook and Nook included), don&rsquo;t mind Adobe Air and are not too bothered that it doesn&rsquo;t look/work like anything you&rsquo;ve used before.</p>

<h3>Nozbe</h3>


<p><a href="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Nozbe.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-795" title="Nozbe" src="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Nozbe.png" alt="" width="640" height="406" /></a></p>

<p><strong>For the high price it has to be the best and I don&rsquo;t think it is (yet).</strong> The brownish UI for Mac just doesn&rsquo;t work, I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on it, is it because the colour palette looks like something off a toddlers app? I&rsquo;m not sure. My biggest turn-off was their New Android app. With a small number of tasks it was slow. What would it be like with many more? It also looks like I&rsquo;m not the only one having problems, it gets a right panning in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nozbe.droid">reviews on the Google Play store</a> which worries me more. To be fair they&rsquo;ve only just released their new Mac and Android apps, so perhaps one to keep an eye on for the future.</p>

<p>This is for you, if you after an app that is GTD all over, simple to understand, you use <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> and/or <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, your patient (as they get out of beta quality), rich and your favourite colour is brown.</p>

<h3>TODO for Mac, Due Today &amp; Toodledoo</h3>


<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-930" title="TODO-Toodledo-DueToday" src="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/TODO-Toodledo-DueToday.png" alt="TODO, Toodledo and Due Today" width="640" height="398" /></p>

<p><strong>These apps come in as a threesome</strong>, working together to provide one trusted system. TODO for my Mac, Due Today for my Android phone and Toodledo for access anywhere (it&rsquo;s Web) and providing the core service/glue that the other 2 sync with. One of the advantages of Toodledo is the <strong>many of 3rd party apps</strong>, so if I find that I don&rsquo;t like Due Today, I can swap it out for one of the other many apps that sync with Toodledo. One particular app that caught my eye was <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.guidedways.android2do">2Do</a>.</p>

<p>Some people love Toodledo but I can&rsquo;t get over its <strong>poor user experience</strong>. I don&rsquo;t come away feeling happy, I just feel frustrated. It&rsquo;s not alone, TODO for Macs task editing is jarring and the overall experience is mundane. They&rsquo;re great at being functional, they just don&rsquo;t delight. Due Today has it&rsquo;s own foibles, chipping in with <em>Floating Tasks</em>!?</p>

<p>The other main problem, was the <strong>inconsistent experience</strong>. Not a fault of any individual app but nevertheless a problem as a whole. Take projects for example; TODO calls them <em>lists</em>, Due Today calls them <em>projects</em> and Toodledo calls them <em>folders</em>. They also have different special lists. Due Today has one called <em>Future</em>, TODO has one called <em>Focus</em>. The split boxes work differently too, TODO shows in gray the total number of tasks and in red the number that are overdue. Whereas Due Today shows in grey the number of tasks not overdue and in red those that are overdue. So for 4 tasks, 2 of which are overdue. TODO would be 2:4 and Due Today 2:2. TODO orders tasks but then this order isn&rsquo;t the same on the other 2.</p>

<p>This is for you, if you are a power user and are after an app/s that is extremely customisable, has tons of features, has multiple clients to choose from and you can live with fugly UIs.</p>

<h3>Doit.im</h3>


<p><a href="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Doit-im.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-413" title="Doit-im" src="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Doit-im.png" alt="Doit.im" width="600" height="300" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Doit.im has the best GTD implementation</strong> I&rsquo;ve seen. It&rsquo;s designed specifically for GTD and I think it <a title="Doit.im Features" href="http://doit.im/features">aligns itself with GTD</a> perfectly. For example when tasks are created, they&rsquo;re in the inbox (which is not a special folder but more a classification or focus). When you process the inbox the task, it can then can be reclassified as Today, Next, Scheduled, Someday and Waiting. On top of this, independently you can then add to projects and contexts (plus tags for good measure).</p>

<p><strong>Unfortunately Doit.im&rsquo;s Mac app, is unusable</strong>. It&rsquo;s a cut down version of Doit.im (Web\Android) and feel abandoned. Simple things like putting something into &lsquo;Next Action&rsquo; means it will never be seen again in the app and there&rsquo;s no projects for you to browse either.  Sadly that just leaves the Web app for managing tasks on the Mac. It&rsquo;s good and matches the Android app but I did experience slowness at times and it&rsquo;s not so good off-line or with a slow Internet connection.</p>

<p>They also just <a href="http://support.doit.im/entries/21495977-about-the-upcoming-doit-im-pro-membership">announced premium pricing of 20USD,</a> which I think it&rsquo;s great. It provides some re-assurance that they have a way to make money and stick around. Something I was concerned about previously, having been around a long time without making money and not publicly announcing how they would.</p>

<p>This is for you, if you&rsquo;re after a complete GTD style trusted system in one &ndash; for Android, iOS and Web.</p>

<h3>Astrid &amp; Producteev - The Winners!</h3>


<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-929" title="Producteev and Astrid" src="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Producteev-and-Astrid.png" alt="Producteev and Astrid" width="640" height="385" /></p>

<p>It was a close call but I think these pair <strong>just edge it</strong>. There&rsquo;s a <strong>great desktop app</strong> for the Mac (Producteev) and the <strong>best task app I&rsquo;ve seen for Android</strong> (Astrid). They&rsquo;ve got a host of features and even missing the odd one but I think the <strong>User Experience won it over</strong> for me. Both make me smile and that&rsquo;s important. It compels me too look at them, collect on them, organise on them, review on them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had Astrid on my phone for a while (as an inbox to collect stuff on the go) and <strong>it&rsquo;s fun</strong> to use. I&rsquo;ve seen it get better and better with each update, which occur frequently. It&rsquo;s feels good knowing that it&rsquo;s fantastic now and it&rsquo;s being actively being developed, getting better all the time. I love its humour too, with it&rsquo;s reminders, some of them persistent, &ldquo;snooze time is up! Complete &hellip;.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Feel good about yourself! Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;, &ldquo;No more postponing! Complete &hellip;&rdquo;. <strong>I even love their Web app</strong>, I really wanted a desktop client for speed and offline access but this is really nice. It&rsquo;s got a simple bright clean interface, it&rsquo;s like Producteev but on the Web. If they made a Mac one (hint hint) then I&rsquo;d be in heaven.</p>

<p>Producteevs Mac app is brilliant. <strong>It looks beautiful. It&rsquo;s both easy to add tasks and manage them</strong>. Their <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.producteev.android.alpha22">Android app</a> is just OK, it&rsquo;s new and has a long way to go to catch up with Astrid but they&rsquo;ve shown that they can create great apps with their Mac one. If that gets the love the Mac one does, it&rsquo;s another option.</p>

<p>Since the reviews for these 2, there&rsquo;s been some updates too.</p>

<h4>Producteev</h4>


<ul>
    <li>A UI make over (I thought it was great as it was)</li>
    <li>Sub tasks (although they don't sync with Astrids)</li>
    <li>An Android app</li>
</ul>


<h4>Astrid</h4>


<ul>
    <li>Sub tasks (although they don't sync with Producteevs or Astrid.com)</li>
    <li>A lovely new UI, that fits in with Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich)</li>
    <li>More customisations</li>
    <li>A web clipper</li>
    <li>Some ordering on the Android app but don't sync to Producteev or Astrid.com</li>
    <li>Lots of little things which I keep noticing after updates that has me thinking "that's cool". For example; prompts me on missed calls to add a task to call them back or do something else.</li>
</ul>


<h4>This is how they look now</h4>

    <li><strong>Lack of contexts/tags</strong> mean using lists for projects and contexts (tasks can belong to more than one list). Not ideal but do-able. So lists like @home, @phone for contexts would keep them at the top and the '@' signify it's a context, not a project list. Producteev only showing the first 5 lists is a pain.</li>
    <li>A few people complaining that <strong>syncing with Producteev sometimes doesn't work</strong>. I didn't test it long enough to really know, so this a concern.</li>
</ul>


<p>So there your have it. <strong>Producteev and Astrid take the winners medal</strong>. I&rsquo;m going to start using these 2 in anger which will be the real proof. If it all goes horribly wrong I&rsquo;ll report back!</p>

<p><a title="GTD App Review – Producteev" href="http://tomphilip.me/index.php/gtd-app-review-producteev/">Producteev Full Review</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hope you enjoyed the series, I certainly didn&rsquo;t ;) I never foresaw the amount of time and effort it would take. Next time I&rsquo;ll just look at some apps and pick one. <strong>Agree? Which is your fave?</strong></p>

<p>Over and finally out.</p>

<p><a href="http://conqu.com/">Conqu</a> is a good, yet odd in places, looking GTD specific app for a host of platforms, including not so common ones such as <a href="http://uk.blackberry.com/playbook-tablet/overview.jsp">Blackberry Playbook</a> and <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/nook-color-barnes-noble/1100437663">Nook Color</a>. With a decent feature set, clearly and simply laid out.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a real mixed UI. It has an eclectic mix of controls that are just odd and look handmade ie not your standard set. Followed by the inspired zoomed in task view. It&rsquo;s nice and clear, has a nice relevant paper note 3D effect, with a ribbon showing you where it&rsquo;s located and nice big text for the project it&rsquo;s in. Most apps task views are quite functional, Conqu&rsquo;s take is refreshing.</p>

<h2></h2>


<h2>Downsides</h2>


<p>Limited keyboard navigation. Only move up/down main menu, contexts, projects and tab into add task/project.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a native Mac app (Adobe Air), so look and feels very different to anything else on the Mac. It even goes further than that, some of controls aren&rsquo;t recognisable from any OS/device I&rsquo;ve used. They&rsquo;re not recognisable as to what they do (accordions that look like drop-downs) or controls that look similar but then behave differently (Flags vs Energy Level). Especially some of the dialogs for choosing things, they&rsquo;re a cross between a large tooltip, checkbox list and cylinder.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to view your scheduled tasks, as you can only see a week at a time and you must select the day to view its tasks.</p>

<h2>Puzzling</h2>


<p>You can&rsquo;t swipe/scroll up and down to flip between the tasks (when viewing a task).</p>

<p>Obscure task ordering mechanism. Requires starting bulk edit mode, then selecting tasks to move, then choosing a sort option (up, down, first etc) unselect, select another, repeat. Drag and drop? At least it has ordering though.</p>

<h2>Useful Extras</h2>


<ul>
    <li>Time needed to complete a task (comes in quick, med, long or a specific time)</li>
    <li>Amount of energy required to complete the task (low, med, high)</li>
    <li>Assign tasks to other people</li>
    <li>Overdue tasks appear as a badge on the dock icon</li>
    <li>GTD specific menu, has items such as Next, Projects, Contexts, Waiting for, Backburner (Someday maybe)</li>
    <li>Pills in the menu that show the number of tasks vs those that are overdue</li>
    <li>Plenty of filters to filter items in a list/project</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.nozbe.com/">Nozbe&rsquo;s</a> new Mac app is a well thought out <strong>GTD specific app</strong>, that has some great <strong>integration with other popular services like Dropbox and Evernote</strong>.</p>

<p>Nozbe is <strong>specifically designed for GTD</strong>, so benefits from being streamlined for the GTD process and doesn&rsquo;t require bending in some way to make it fit.</p>

<p>The <strong>Dropbox</strong> and <strong>Evernote</strong> integrations, unique to this app (out of those reviewed), make a great addition. Especially as I use both of these services frequently, especially Evernote for a GTD reference bucket.</p>

<p>The Android app has been <strong>re-written with a much improved UI, stability and speed improvements</strong>. So if you&rsquo;ve tried it before and had a torrid time of it, it might be worth a second look.</p>

<p>Bear in mind the Mac app has just come out of beta, so for a first release it&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>

<p><strong>
</strong></p>

<h2>Downsides</h2>


<p>No keyboard navigation in the Mac app.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a little on brown side. The right-hand side editing pane, lacks colour and contrast.</p>

<p>On the Android app, it&rsquo;s a bit sluggish (tested on HTC Desire) and there was the odd error.</p>

<h2>Puzzling</h2>


<p>Fonts seem blurry.</p>

<p>Selected tasks lose their icons and deadline when selected. Would be nice for those to remain, so you don&rsquo;t have to re-find them on the edit pane.</p>

<h2>Useful Extras</h2>


<ul>
    <li>Can tag projects with labels, eg work, home</li>

    <li>Add files to projects</li>
    <li>Associate a dropbox folder a project (looks like the Web app has box.net support too)</li>

    <li>Colour code your projects</li>
    <li>Full-screen for OSX Lion</li>

<p><a title="Producteev" href="http://producteev.com">Producteev</a> for Mac is a beautifully designed task list app, that&rsquo;s a pure joy to use. You can&rsquo;t help but feel that every little piece has been well thought out and designed. It uses contrast and colour to good effect, adding to its looks and helping the user to interact with and visualise tasks.</p>

<p>Adding new tasks is easy. Called up with a hotkey from within any app. It allows extra options (labelling, deadlines, starring etc) to be set too without it being an unwieldy dialog.</p>

<p>Task organisation is easy too, by clicking on the obvious icons to pop-up simple focused dialogs for each property of a task you wish to set (see Setting a Deadline screenshot).</p>

<p><a title="GTD App Review – Astrid" href="http://tomphilip.me/index.php/gtd-app-review-astrid/">Astrid</a> would be the Android client in this trusted system but if their soon to be released Android app is anywhere as good as its Mac app, then I can&rsquo;t wait to see that.</p>

<p>I put <em>no</em> for contexts/tags but you can assign multiple labels to task, so labels could be used for both projects and contexts. Not as nice as separate but a workaround. Another approach is to use Workspaces as projects and labels as contexts. The problem with this is labels belong to a workspace, so it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible to see all tasks for a certain context. Also Google Calendar integration is per workspace, so for each workspace you&rsquo;d get a separate calendar and need to connect this to Google.   <strong>I&rsquo;d be interested to here from anyone who&rsquo;s using/tried either approach and the pros/cons of each.</strong></p>

<h2>Downsides</h2>


<p>Labels not having the option to span Workspaces.</p>

<p>Having to manually connect each workspace to Google Calendar, thus creating a calendar in Google Calendar per workspace.</p>

<h2>Puzzling</h2>


<p>After 5 labels, you need to expand to see the rest of them (see &lsquo;Moving House&rsquo; in the Main Screen screenshot). Shame it just doesn&rsquo;t show them all or allow you to choose how many to show, there&rsquo;s space.</p>

<p><strong>Update 12/9/2012</strong> &ndash; You can actually manually order the lists, by dragging and dropping them into the top half (above the <em>more</em>). So this puzzler goes away.</p>

<p>Dock badges just seem to be for tasks that you&rsquo;ve assigned to others or have has assigned to you (I didn&rsquo;t get to verify this with someone, so this is I&rsquo;m assuming where dock badges come in). I was expecting to get badges for overdue tasks.</p>

<h2>Useful Extras</h2>


<ul>
    <li>Import tasks from Remember the Milk.</li>
    <li>Multiple notes per task.</li>
    <li>Attach a file with each note. Multiple notes mean you can attach multiple files. 100mb file storage limit for free accounts.</li>
    <li>Workspaces for top level partitioning of tasks. Eg Work, Home etc.</li>
    <li>Enhanced for OSX Lion.</li>
    <li>Global hot key to bring up new task box.</li>
    <li>Audit trail. So you can see the history of what's happened to a task.</li>
    <li>Assign tasks to other people.</li>
    <li>Collaborate on Workspaces.</li>
    <li>You can create your own filters using quite an extensive criteria and remove the default ones to.</li>
    <li>Smart task entry. Eg ** walk the dog tomorrow, adds a task with 2 stars and a deadline of tomorrow</li>
    <li>All items (labels and Filters) in the left menu can be dragged and dropped to re-order them.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://astrid.com">Astrid</a> is <strong>popular task list app for Android</strong>, that is easy to use and comes with a <strong>host of syncing options</strong>. Incredibly simple and straight forward to use with a pleasant <strong>clean UI</strong>.</p>

<p>It stands out from other task list apps, with some unique features such as backups, random notifications for overdue tasks and encouragements.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Downsides</h2>


<p>It&rsquo;s an impressive app but the lack of GTD specific folders and contexts/tags, means it loses out to those that have them. They of course can be replicated with lists (tasks can belong to more than one list).</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t add a task from the lists home page and you can&rsquo;t set the lists page as your <em>home screen</em>.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t remove or customise the default filters. Like &lsquo;Recently Modified&rsquo; which doesn&rsquo;t feel like a useful filter.</p>

<h2>Puzzling</h2>


<p>Nothing puzzling, just a straight forward task list app.</p>

<h2>Useful Extras</h2>


<ul>
    <li>Time how long it takes to perform a task.</li>
    <li>Workspaces for top level partitioning of tasks. Eg Work, Home etc. When used with Producteev sync.</li>
    <li>Assign tasks to other people and collaborate on lists too.</li>
    <li>Randomly <del>remind</del> nag you of overdue tasks.</li>
    <li>Limited smart task entry. Eg add to list #listname would add the task to <em>listname</em></li>
    <li>Power packs for more widgets, notifications based on location and voice integration.</li>
    <li>Widget for any list/view of tasks.</li>
    <li>Add limited filters.</li>
    <li>Reminders come with encouragements to complete overdue tasks and a host of other reminder settings.</li>
    <li>Specify defaults for tasks.</li>
    <li>Automated backups, should anything go wrong.</li>
    <li>The app is <a href="https://github.com/todoroo/astrid">open source</a>.</li>
    <li>Syncs with <a href="http://www.producteev.com/">Producteev</a>, <a href="http://mail.google.com/tasks">Google Tasks</a> and it's own new <a href="http://astrid.com/features">Web app</a>.</li>
