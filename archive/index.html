    <h1 class="post__title"><a href="/best-gtd-app/">The Best GTD App</a></h1>

  </header>

  <div class="post__content">When I started this review process back in September 2011, eager to find the perfect GTD app for myself. I was looking forward to whizzing through the reviews, to find a winning app that would meet my needs set out in the <a title="GTD App Review â Who and What" href="http://tomphilip.me/index.php/gtd-app-review-introduction/">opening post</a>. I was writing the reviews, at times, twice a week. Then babies, work and disillusionment set in. The latter came about as it slowly dawned on me that there wouldn&#8217;t be a clear winner, a perfect GTD for me (and others).

The conclusions I&#8217;m about to draw, as I choose my &#8216;perfect&#8217; GTD system, will be a story of compromise. <strong>Will the app be, not perfect, but just good enough? Will missing features be made in the future? Many a &#8220;it would be perfect if &#8230;&#8221;.</strong>
<h2>Recap</h2>
<strong>The full story is in the <a title="GTD App Review â Who and What" href="http://tomphilip.me/index.php/gtd-app-review-introduction/">opening post</a></strong>. To find the perfect app, I came up with some basic criteria the app had to meet in order to be considered, this got the list down from over a hundred to a manageable 9 (10 originally, until I realised <a href="http://getitdoneapp.com/">Get It Done</a> didn&#8217;t have a Mac app).
<ul>
	<li>Multi Device â Mac, Android and Windows</li>
	<li>Quick</li>
	<li>Available Off-line with Cloud Syncing</li>
	<li>Beautiful/Great User Experience (UX)</li>
</ul>
The following 9 shortlisted apps then got an in depth review:
<ul>
	<li><a title="GTD App Review â TODO for Mac" href="http://tomphilip.me/index.php/gtd-app-review-todo-for-mac/">TODO for Mac</a></li>
	<li><a title="GTD App Review â Due Today" href="http://tomphilip.me/index.php/gtd-app-review-due-today/">Due Today</a></li>
	<li><a title="GTD App Review â Toodledo" href="http://tomphilip.me/index.php/gtd-app-review-toodledo/">Toodledo</a></li>

	<li><a title="GTD App Review â Conqu" href="http://tomphilip.me/index.php/gtd-app-review-conqu/">Conqu</a></li>
</ul>
&#8230; and now here we are, about to find outÂ  which I think is best and which will become my trusted system?
<h2>Comparison Chart</h2>
If you&#8217;re after a quick comparison, here&#8217;s <strong>how their features compared</strong>. The criteria is taken from my thoughts on what makes a great GTD app, outlined in the <a title="GTD App Review â Who and What" href="http://tomphilip.me/index.php/gtd-app-review-introduction/">introduction post</a>. I&#8217;ve included some &#8216;nice to have&#8217; features that I discovered which I enjoyed and/or were useful.

<h2>Honourable mentions</h2>
These apps didn&#8217;t get reviewed because they lacked some feature/s that made them unsuitable. I liked how they looked and their features, they show great promise:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.nirvanahq.com/">Nirvana</a> - Well thought out, great looking GTD web app.</li>
	<li><a href="http://asana.com/">Assana</a> - Good looking, collaborative task manager.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.smartytask.com/">Smarty Task</a> - Great looking GTD app with some smart filters.</li>
	<li><a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/">Omnifocus</a> - Users of these had great things to say about them but sadly Mac only.</li>
	<li><a href="http://get.wunderkit.com/">Wunderkit</a> - Wunderlists big brother, fantastic UI for collaborative task management.</li>
	<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anydo">Any.DO</a> - Slick Android app with intriguing gestures.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Runners Up</h2>
It was really hard to choose my apps to make up my trusted system. There wasn&#8217;t a single one that looked like a clear winner. All of them had at least one thing wrong or missing. So it&#8217;s not that the runners up are bad apps, it&#8217;s just that the others were better, sometimes marginally.
<h3>Wunderlist</h3>
<a href="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Wunderlist.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-465" title="Wunderlist" src="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Wunderlist.png" alt="" width="640" height="481" /></a>

<strong>I love Wunderlists simplicity and looks</strong> but the lack of tags or appearing in more than one list, means no contexts. Based on that alone it loses out. Although there might be reprieve for this, as I&#8217;ve been using it for a while for my work tasks for <a title="Life Tuned - Music Memory Box" href="http://lifetuned.com">Life Tuned</a> and <a title="Pik Pak - Create, discover and share packing lists" href="http://pikpak.me">Pik Pak</a>, in a kind of personal Kanban. With its drag &#8216;n&#8217; drop task ordering (something surprisingly missing on most), it makes easy just-in-time ordering of the next tasks to do in a project, so it might remain as part of the system.

This is for you, if you after an app that has great looks, fantastic simple UX,Â  same experience across multiple platforms and are happy with basic task organisation.

<h3>Conqu</h3>
<a href="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Conqu.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-847" title="Conqu" src="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Conqu.png" alt="Conqu" width="640" height="410" /></a>

<strong>The odd UI and it&#8217;s clunky-ness is just something that would grate on me after a time</strong>, it bewildered me in the short time I used it. Plus missing features, like task recurrences (essential for doing stuff like monthly accounts) and Google calendar sync puts this one out of the running.

This is for you, if you after an app that looks good, supports many platforms (Playbook and Nook included), don&#8217;t mind Adobe Air and are not too bothered that it doesn&#8217;t look/work like anything you&#8217;ve used before.

<h3>Nozbe</h3>
<a href="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Nozbe.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-795" title="Nozbe" src="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Nozbe.png" alt="" width="640" height="406" /></a>

<strong>For the high price it has to be the best and I don&#8217;t think it is (yet).</strong> The brownish UI for Mac just doesn&#8217;t work, I can&#8217;t quite put my finger on it, is it because the colour palette looks like something off a toddlers app? I&#8217;m not sure. My biggest turn-off was their New Android app. With a small number of tasks it was slow. What would it be like with many more? It also looks like I&#8217;m not the only one having problems, it gets a right panning in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nozbe.droid">reviews on the Google Play store</a> which worries me more. To be fair they&#8217;ve only just released their new Mac and Android apps, so perhaps one to keep an eye on for the future.

This is for you, if you after an app that is GTD all over, simple to understand, you use <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> and/or <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, your patient (as they get out of beta quality), rich and your favourite colour is brown.

<h3>TODO for Mac, Due Today &amp; Toodledoo</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-930" title="TODO-Toodledo-DueToday" src="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/TODO-Toodledo-DueToday.png" alt="TODO, Toodledo and Due Today" width="640" height="398" />

<strong>These apps come in as a threesome</strong>, working together to provide one trusted system. TODO for my Mac, Due Today for my Android phone and Toodledo for access anywhere (it&#8217;s Web) and providing the core service/glue that the other 2 sync with. One of the advantages of Toodledo is the <strong>many of 3rd party apps</strong>, so if I find that I don&#8217;t like Due Today, I can swap it out for one of the other many apps that sync with Toodledo. One particular app that caught my eye was <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.guidedways.android2do">2Do</a>.

Some people love Toodledo but I can&#8217;t get over its <strong>poor user experience</strong>. I don&#8217;t come away feeling happy, I just feel frustrated. It&#8217;s not alone, TODO for Macs task editing is jarring and the overall experience is mundane. They&#8217;re great at being functional, they just don&#8217;t delight. Due Today has it&#8217;s own foibles, chipping in with <em>Floating Tasks</em>!?

The other main problem, was the <strong>inconsistent experience</strong>. Not a fault of any individual app but nevertheless a problem as a whole. Take projects for example; TODO calls them <em>lists</em>, Due Today calls them <em>projects</em> and Toodledo calls them <em>folders</em>. They also have different special lists. Due Today has one called <em>Future</em>, TODO has one called <em>Focus</em>. The split boxes work differently too, TODO shows in gray the total number of tasks and in red the number that are overdue. Whereas Due Today shows in grey the number of tasks not overdue and in red those that are overdue. So for 4 tasks, 2 of which are overdue. TODO would be 2:4 and Due Today 2:2. TODO orders tasks but then this order isn&#8217;t the same on the other 2.

This is for you, if you are a power user and are after an app/s that is extremely customisable, has tons of features, has multiple clients to choose from and you can live with fugly UIs.

<h3>Doit.im</h3>
<a href="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Doit-im.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-413" title="Doit-im" src="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Doit-im.png" alt="Doit.im" width="600" height="300" /></a>

<strong>Doit.im has the best GTD implementation</strong> I&#8217;ve seen. It&#8217;s designed specifically for GTD and I think it <a title="Doit.im Features" href="http://doit.im/features">aligns itself with GTD</a> perfectly. For example when tasks are created, they&#8217;re in the inbox (which is not a special folder but more a classification or focus). When you process the inbox the task, it can then can be reclassified as Today, Next, Scheduled, Someday and Waiting. On top of this, independently you can then add to projects and contexts (plus tags for good measure).

<strong>Unfortunately Doit.im&#8217;s Mac app, is unusable</strong>. It&#8217;s a cut down version of Doit.im (Web\Android) and feel abandoned. Simple things like putting something into &#8216;Next Action&#8217; means it will never be seen again in the app and there&#8217;s no projects for you to browse either.Â  Sadly that just leaves the Web app for managing tasks on the Mac. It&#8217;s good and matches the Android app but I did experience slowness at times and it&#8217;s not so good off-line or with a slow Internet connection.

They also just <a href="http://support.doit.im/entries/21495977-about-the-upcoming-doit-im-pro-membership">announced premium pricing of 20USD,</a> which I think it&#8217;s great. It provides some re-assurance that they have a way to make money and stick around. Something I was concerned about previously, having been around a long time without making money and not publicly announcing how they would.

This is for you, if you&#8217;re after a complete GTD style trusted system in one - for Android, iOS and Web.

<h3>Astrid &amp; Producteev - The Winners!</h3>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-929" title="Producteev and Astrid" src="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Producteev-and-Astrid.png" alt="Producteev and Astrid" width="640" height="385" />

It was a close call but I think these pair <strong>just edge it</strong>. There&#8217;s a <strong>great desktop app</strong> for the Mac (Producteev) and the <strong>best task app I&#8217;ve seen for Android</strong> (Astrid). They&#8217;ve got a host of features and even missing the odd one but I think the <strong>User Experience won it over</strong> for me. Both make me smile and that&#8217;s important. It compels me too look at them, collect on them, organise on them, review on them.

I&#8217;ve had Astrid on my phone for a while (as an inbox to collect stuff on the go) and <strong>it&#8217;s fun</strong> to use. I&#8217;ve seen it get better and better with each update, which occur frequently. It&#8217;s feels good knowing that it&#8217;s fantastic now and it&#8217;s being actively being developed, getting better all the time. I love its humour too, with it&#8217;s reminders, some of them persistent, &#8220;snooze time is up! Complete &#8230;.&#8221;, &#8220;Feel good about yourself! Let&#8217;s go!&#8221;, &#8220;No more postponing! Complete &#8230;&#8221;. <strong>I even love their Web app</strong>, I really wanted a desktop client for speed and offline access but this is really nice. It&#8217;s got a simple bright clean interface, it&#8217;s like Producteev but on the Web. If they made a Mac one (hint hint) then I&#8217;d be in heaven.

Producteevs Mac app is brilliant. <strong>It looks beautiful. It&#8217;s both easy to add tasks and manage them</strong>. Their <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.producteev.android.alpha22">Android app</a> is just OK, it&#8217;s new and has a long way to go to catch up with Astrid but they&#8217;ve shown that they can create great apps with their Mac one. If that gets the love the Mac one does, it&#8217;s another option.

Since the reviews for these 2, there&#8217;s been some updates too.
<h4>Producteev</h4>
<ul>
	<li>A UI make over (I thought it was great as it was)</li>
	<li>Sub tasks (although they don&#8217;t sync with Astrids)</li>
	<li>An Android app</li>
</ul>
<h4>Astrid</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Sub tasks (although they don&#8217;t sync with Producteevs or Astrid.com)</li>
	<li>A lovely new UI, that fits in with Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich)</li>
	<li>More customisations</li>
	<li>A web clipper</li>
	<li>Some ordering on the Android app but don&#8217;t sync to Producteev or Astrid.com</li>
	<li>Lots of little things which I keep noticing after updates that has me thinking &#8220;that&#8217;s cool&#8221;. For example; prompts me on missed calls to add a task to call them back or do something else.</li>
</ul>
<h4>This is how they look now</h4>
[gallery exclude=&#8221;928,929,930,987&#8221; link=&#8221;file&#8221;]

&nbsp;

It&#8217;s not all roses, there&#8217;s some workarounds/concerns:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lack of contexts/tags</strong> mean using lists for projects and contexts (tasks can belong to more than one list). Not ideal but do-able. So lists like @home, @phone for contexts would keep them at the top and the &#8216;@&#8217; signify it&#8217;s a context, not a project list. Producteev only showing the first 5 lists is a pain.</li>
	<li>A few people complaining that <strong>syncing with Producteev sometimes doesn&#8217;t work</strong>. I didn&#8217;t test it long enough to really know, so this a concern.</li>
</ul>
So there your have it. <strong>Producteev and Astrid take the winners medal</strong>. I&#8217;m going to start using these 2 in anger which will be the real proof. If it all goes horribly wrong I&#8217;ll report back!

Hope you enjoyed the series, I certainly didn&#8217;t ;) I never foresaw the amount of time and effort it would take. Next time I&#8217;ll just look at some apps and pick one. <strong>Agree? Which is your fave?</strong>

Over and finally out.

<a href="http://conqu.com/">Conqu</a> is a good, yet odd in places, looking GTD specific app for a host of platforms, including not so common ones such as <a href="http://uk.blackberry.com/playbook-tablet/overview.jsp">Blackberry Playbook</a> and <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/nook-color-barnes-noble/1100437663">Nook Color</a>. With a decent feature set, clearly and simply laid out.

It&#8217;s a real mixed UI. It has an eclectic mix of controls that are just odd and look handmade ie not your standard set. Followed by the inspired zoomed in task view. It&#8217;s nice and clear, has a nice relevant paper note 3D effect, with a ribbon showing you where it&#8217;s located and nice big text for the project it&#8217;s in. Most apps task views are quite functional, Conqu&#8217;s take is refreshing.

<h2></h2>
<h2>Downsides</h2>
Limited keyboard navigation. Only move up/down main menu, contexts, projects and tab into add task/project.

It&#8217;s not a native Mac app (Adobe Air), so look and feels very different to anything else on the Mac. It even goes further than that, some of controls aren&#8217;t recognisable from any OS/device I&#8217;ve used. They&#8217;re not recognisable as to what they do (accordions that look like drop-downs) or controls that look similar but then behave differently (Flags vs Energy Level). Especially some of the dialogs for choosing things, they&#8217;re a cross between a large tooltip, checkbox list and cylinder.

It&#8217;s difficult to view your scheduled tasks, as you can only see a week at a time and you must select the day to view its tasks.
<h2>Puzzling</h2>
You can&#8217;t swipe/scroll up and down to flip between the tasks (when viewing a task).

Obscure task ordering mechanism. Requires starting bulk edit mode, then selecting tasks to move, then choosing a sort option (up, down, first etc) unselect, select another, repeat. Drag and drop? At least it has ordering though.
<h2>Useful Extras</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Time needed to complete a task (comes in quick, med, long or a specific time)</li>
	<li>Amount of energy required to complete the task (low, med, high)</li>
	<li>Assign tasks to other people</li>
	<li>Overdue tasks appear as a badge on the dock icon</li>
	<li>GTD specific menu, has items such as Next, Projects, Contexts, Waiting for, Backburner (Someday maybe)</li>
	<li>Pills in the menu that show the number of tasks vs those that are overdue</li>
	<li>Plenty of filters to filter items in a list/project</li>
</ul>

<a href="http://www.nozbe.com/">Nozbe&#8217;s</a> new Mac app is a well thought out <strong>GTD specific app</strong>, that has some great <strong>integration with other popular services like Dropbox and Evernote</strong>.

Nozbe is <strong>specifically designed for GTD</strong>, so benefits from being streamlined for the GTD process and doesn&#8217;t require bending in some way to make it fit.

The <strong>Dropbox</strong> and <strong>Evernote</strong> integrations, unique to this app (out of those reviewed), make a great addition. Especially as I use both of these services frequently, especially Evernote for a GTD reference bucket.

The Android app has been <strong>re-written with a much improved UI, stability and speed improvements</strong>. So if you&#8217;ve tried it before and had a torrid time of it, it might be worth a second look.

Bear in mind the Mac app has just come out of beta, so for a first release it&#8217;s pretty good.

<h2>Downsides</h2>
No keyboard navigation in the Mac app.

It&#8217;s a little on brown side. The right-hand side editing pane, lacks colour and contrast.

On the Android app, it&#8217;s a bit sluggish (tested on HTC Desire) and there was the odd error.
<h2>Puzzling</h2>
Fonts seem blurry.

Selected tasks lose their icons and deadline when selected. Would be nice for those to remain, so you don&#8217;t have to re-find them on the edit pane.
<h2>Useful Extras</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Can tag projects with labels, eg work, home</li>
	<li>Smart task entry with hashes to add context, deadlines, project, comment etc</li>
	<li>Looks like you can invite people to work on a project</li>
	<li>Time needed to complete a task</li>
	<li>Add multiple notes to a project</li>
	<li>Add files to projects</li>
	<li>Associate a dropbox folder a project (looks like the Web app has box.net support too)</li>
	<li>Evernote notes tagged with your project name get associated with that project</li>
	<li>Colour code your projects</li>
	<li>Full-screen for OSX Lion</li>
	<li>Can add how long you think a task might take</li>
	<li>Backup/export everything (except files) from Nozbe</li>
	<li>Add tasks via Twitter</li>
</ul>

<a href="http://xkcd.greatboxee.com">XKCD Couch</a> has a new feature. <strong>The Remote Control</strong>.

<strong>The remote control is tucked out the way in a drawer at the bottom of the screen</strong>. Press either up or down on your remote control/keyboard to open the drawer. On the remote are 5 new navigation buttons (from left to right):
<ul>
	<li><strong>Latest</strong> - navigates to the latest comic</li>
	<li><strong>Skip forward</strong> - skips forward 20 comics</li>
	<li><strong>Random</strong> - jumps to a random comic</li>
	<li><strong>Skip back</strong> - skips back 20 comics</li>
	<li><strong>First</strong> - navigates to the first ever comic</li>
</ul>
Escape or up/down closes the drawer.
<h3>Mouse Support</h3>
Although the app is intended for use from the couch with a remote control, there&#8217;s now mouse support. So all buttons/arrows/drawer handles are clickable plus there&#8217;s the image text in the tooltip.

<a title="XKCD Couch" href="http://xkcd.greatboxee.com">Check it out</a> and enjoy.

  </header>

  <div class="post__content"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-761" title="cassette" src="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cassette.jpg" alt="Cassette Tape" width="640" height="504" />

<strong>In a nutshell, <a href="http://getcassette.net/">Cassette</a> will minify, combine, compress and cache your css and javascript files, reducing your page load times.</strong> It does a <a title="more benefits of Cassette" href="http://getcassette.net/benefits">heap more</a> too like <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a>, <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">Coffeescript</a>, file ordering, debug vs release files, html templates, CDN assets and more.

It&#8217;s easy to <a title="getting started with Cassette" href="http://getcassette.net/documentation/getting-started">get started</a> with too. No more complicated than referencing your css and javascript files directly.
<h2>No Excuses</h2>
I hadn&#8217;t implemented any minifying, combining, etc for my app <a title="Create, Discover and Share Packing Lists" href="http://pikpak.me">Pik Pak</a>. As I saw it (with my lean goggles on), it worked fine, it was good enough. I could benefit from it but really was the effort worth it. I&#8217;d bookmarked Cassette ages ago when it was Knapsack and made it a someday-maybe task. As I was giving Pik Pak a facelift, removing a garish design and replacing with the wonderful <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, it was time to bring it in.

My opinion has changed, it is worth it. It takes so little effort. I know in my next asp.net project it will go in at the beginning, it&#8217;s so easy to use there&#8217;s no excuse not too (Except perhaps 1, if you&#8217;re not using .NET 4.0). In dev I get the scripts unaltered, just like I&#8217;d inserted them manually and in prod they get minified, compressed and combined.
<h2>How it Works (Briefly)</h2>
I want to share with you a little bit about how it works, as it wasn&#8217;t clear to me at first. I originally mistook the <a href="http://getcassette.net/documentation/getting-started">Bundle.Reference() calls</a> to be informing Cassette about the asset and saying it&#8217;s required on this page. There&#8217;s actually 3 parts to Cassette, in it&#8217;s simplest form (there&#8217;s tons more to it):

There are 3 parts to getting your scripts/css combined, minified etc
<h3>1. Tell Cassette about your css/js files</h3>
Cassette doesn&#8217;t automatically discover your files (assets), you need to tell it where they are and how they should be combined (bundles). A <a href="http://getcassette.net/documentation/getting-started/assets-and-bundles">bundle</a> is a number of files that will be combined into one minified/compressed file (in production) that is referenced by one script/stylesheet tag, thus causing a single download. The default CasseteConfiguration.css that get&#8217;s dropped in by nuget creates a bundle for every css or javascript file. Which is better than nothing. You&#8217;re getting minification, compression, caching, versioning but it&#8217;s still a download per file, there&#8217;s no combining. So you want to define bundles to minimise the number of downloads the browser has to make.

As well as defining what goes into a bundle you can also define the order within bundle and dependencies between bundles or files. Eg your script might depend on a framework like jQuery or Backbone.

There&#8217;s a number of ways to define what goes into a bundle.
<ul>
	<li>A bundle per file (default config). <code>bundles.AddPerIndividualFile&lt;StylesheetBundle&gt;("Content/Stylesheets");</code></li>
	<li><a href="http://getcassette.net/documentation/configuration/add-directory">A folder as a bundle</a>. <code>bundles.Add&lt;StylesheetBundle&gt;("Content/Stylesheets");</code></li>
	<li>Â A <a href="http://getcassette.net/documentation/configuration/add-per-sub-directory">folder as a bundle and each direct subfolder as a bundle</a> to. <code>bundles.AddPerSubDirectory&lt;<code>ScriptBundle</code>&gt;(&#8220;Scripts&#8221;);</code></li>
</ul>
All of these kind be fine tuned to.

Defining the order they get rendered and dependencies (If your script depends on jquery and you reference your file or bundle in a page, jquery will automatically be pulled in) can be:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://getcassette.net/documentation/AssetReferences">Embedded in the file itself</a>. <code>// @reference ~/lib/backbone.js</code> <strong>or</strong> <code>/// &lt;reference path="~/lib/backbone.js" /&gt;</code></li>
	<li>or in <a href="http://getcassette.net/documentation/configuration/bundle-descriptor-file">bundle.txt files</a> in the folders that are being bundled.</li>
</ul>
If you&#8217;re still with me! Defining the bundles is the most difficult part but once you&#8217;re done the next 2 are straight forward.
<h3>2. Request scripts to be added to the page</h3>
This is were <a href="http://getcassette.net/documentation/getting-started/assets-and-bundles">inform Casssette, that you need xyx file on this page</a>. This can be in your master page/Razor layout, page or partial view. You can either
<ul>
	<li>reference the file itself (and the containing bundle will be inserted) <code>@Bundles.Reference("lib/backbone/backbone.marionette.js");</code></li>
	<li>or you can reference the bundle <code>@Bundles.Reference("lib/backbone")</code></li>
</ul>
You can also optionally specify where the script should be rendered. <code>@Bundles.Reference("lib/modernizr.js", "header")</code>
<h3>3. Render the scripts</h3>
Call into Cassette to render the script/css tags at that point. Normally this will be one or 2 lines in your layout/masterpage file.

[codesyntax lang=&#8221;asp&#8221;]
<pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Web App&lt;/title&gt;
    @Bundles.RenderStylesheets()
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    ...
    @Bundles.RenderScripts()
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
[/codesyntax]

There&#8217;s so much more, all in the <a href="http://getcassette.net/documentation/">documentation</a>.
<h2>Tips</h2>
So far, these are my thoughts on how to get the best out of Cassette with least effort.
<h3>Render scripts before closing body tags</h3>
Everyone knows you should render your scripts before the closing body tags, to prevent the page load being blocked. Have your main <code>@Bundles.RenderScripts();</code> before the closing body tags and have a specific oneÂ <code>@Bundles.RenderScripts("header")</code> in the header for those scripts that need it (<a href="http://www.modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a>).
<h3>jQuery CDN</h3>
If your using jquery, you should create a bundle just for itself. Create a folder (probably called jquery), add the jquery file and a bundle.txt file containing the following:

[codesyntax lang=&#8221;ini&#8221;]
<pre>[external]
url = //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js
fallbackCondition = !window.jQuery

[assets]
jquery.js</pre>
[/codesyntax]

Then reference the bundle as normal <code>@Bundles.Reference("scripts/jquery");</code> In dev you get your full jquery js file and in prod you get googles cdn jquery file (most likely already cached in the broswer) with a fallback to your minified/compressed one.
<h3>Convention</h3>
Use <code>bundles.AddPerSubDirectory&lt;ScriptBundle&gt;("Scripts");</code> and arrange your scripts/css into folders for each bundle you want. That way you don&#8217;t have to go back and touch the CasetteConfiguration. You can leave it upto convention and fine tune with a bundle.txt file in the folders/bundles where needed.

It&#8217;d be great to hear how your using Cassette, in the comments and any tips that have helped.

An app for lounging on your couch, with your remote control, flicking through <a title="XKCD Comics" href="http://xkcd.com">XCKD</a> comics on your TV.

<strong>Available now, for use right in your browser at <a title="XKCD Couch" href="http://xkcd.greatboxee.com">http://xkcd.greatboxee.com</a></strong>

<strong>Designed for the big screen and a remote.</strong> Use you left and right arrow keys on your remote/keyboard to navigate through the comics. Use the select/enter/space type key reveal the good old &#8216;alt&#8217; text.
<h2>Technology</h2>
A bit about the technology behind it. It&#8217;a single page HTML5 app that uses <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a> as it&#8217;s underlying framework, that was tested with the BDD framework <a title="Jasmine - BDD for Javascript" href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> and mocking library <a title="Standalone test spies, stubs and mocks for JavaScript." href="http://sinonjs.org/">Sinon.js</a>. Early parts of this app appeared in my previous post on <a title="Testing Backbone with Jasmine and Sinon" href="http://tomphilip.me/index.php/testing-backbone-with-jasmine-and-sinon/">Testing Backbone.js with Jasmine and Sinon.js</a>. It also spawned a Backbone plugin called <a title="Backbone on the Couch" href="http://tomphilip.me/index.php/backbone-on-the-couch/">Backbone on the Couch</a>, which allows you to easily bind to remote control d-pad events (left, right, up, down etc).

Works on modern browers and maybe even some of the older ones. It&#8217;s also part of a <a href="http://www.greatboxee.com/index.php/2012/01/30/xkcd-app-reborn/">html5 app for Boxee</a>.

Enjoy :) and I welcome your feedback.

A simple <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone">Backbone.js</a> plugin for use in leanback apps, where someone is sat on the couch using a remote control to use your app. It&#8217;s open source. You can get it and fork it at <strong><a title="Backbone on the Couch source code" href="https://github.com/tommysqueak/Backbone-On-The-Couch">Backbone on the Couch on github</a></strong>

Gives you something even your mum can understand

[codesyntax lang=&#8221;javascript&#8221;]

keypad.bind(&#8220;key:left&#8221;, doSomething);

[/codesyntax]

<strong>vs</strong>

What does the magic number 37 mean?

[codesyntax lang=&#8221;javascript&#8221;]
switch(e.which)
{
case: 37
doSomething();
break;
etc:
etc:
andsoon:
}
[/codesyntax]
<h2>Usages</h2>
In its simplest form you can do the following:

[codesyntax lang=&#8221;javascript&#8221;]
var keypad = new Backbone.OnTheCouch.KeyEvents();

// listen for any of the commonly used d-pad keys (left, right, up, down, enter, space and escape)
keypad.bind(&#8220;key:up&#8221;, function(){//do something on up});
[/codesyntax]

If you&#8217;re using an event aggregator or something else. You can have the events trigger on that instead:

[codesyntax lang=&#8221;javascript&#8221;]
var eventAggregator = _.extend({}, Backbone.Events);
var keypad = new Backbone.OnTheCouch.KeyEvents({triggerOn: eventAggregator});

eventAggregator.bind(&#8220;key:up&#8221;, function(){//do something on up});
[/codesyntax]

You can also replace the d-pad key defaults and provide your own keys that you want to listen for:

[codesyntax lang=&#8221;javascript&#8221;]
var keypad = new Backbone.OnTheCouch.KeyEvents({keyMaps: [
new Backbone.OnTheCouch.KeyEvent(188, &#8220;key:comma&#8221;),
new Backbone.OnTheCouch.KeyEvent(190, &#8220;key:fullstop&#8221;)
]});

keypad.bind(&#8220;key:comma&#8221;, function(){//do something odd});
[/codesyntax]
<h2>Example</h2>
The plugin came out of the development of the <a href="http://tomphilip.me/index.php/introducing-xkcd-couch/">XKCD Couch app</a>, which is also a <a href="http://www.greatboxee.com/index.php/2012/01/30/xkcd-app-reborn/">html5 Boxee app</a>. You can see this plugin at work on <a href="http://xkcd.greatboxee.com">XKCD Couch app</a>.

This is based on an <strong><a href="http://xkcd.com">XKCD</a> leanback web app</strong> I&#8217;m working on that will form part of a html5 <a title="Boxee app developer" href="http://www.greatboxee.com">Boxee app</a>. Think sitting on your couch, remote control in hand flicking through XKCD comics on the TV.

It brings together quite a few technologies and techniques. The end results is something that is separated out nicely (no spaghetti code) that is simple, testable, documented and maintainable.
<h2>The Specs</h2>
[codesyntax lang=&#8221;javascript&#8221; tab_width=&#8221;1&#8221;]
<pre>describe("Comic Navigator", function(){

	var nav = new Xkcd.ComicNavigator();
	var latestComic = new Xkcd.Comic({id: 101});

	describe("when navigating to the latest xkcd comic", function(){

		beforeEach(function(){
			this.fetchStub = sinon.stub(Xkcd.Comic.prototype, 'fetch').yieldsTo('success', latestComic);

			nav.toLatest();
		});

		afterEach(function(){
			this.fetchStub.restore();
		});

		it("should fetch the latest comic. NB requests without a comic number get the latest comic.", function(){
			expect(this.fetchStub.thisValues[0].get("id")).toBeFalsy();
		});

		it("should navigate to the latest comic", function(){
			expect(nav.get("current")).toBe(latestComic);
		});

		it("should keep track of what the latest comic is", function(){
			expect(nav.get("latest")).toBe(latestComic);
		});
	});
});</pre>
[/codesyntax]
<h3>So what&#8217;s going on?</h3>
<strong><a title="Jasmine BDD Framework for Javascript" href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> is the BDD framework</strong> that is giving us that familiar &#8216;describe/it&#8217; way of defining the behaviour and at the code level the expect-ations. It&#8217;s easy to understand and get started with. It doesn&#8217;t have to be run in the browser as it has no dependency on the DOM, so is CI friendly too.

<strong><a title="Mocking, stubbing, spying framework for Javascript" href="http://sinonjs.org/">Sinon.JS</a> is the mocking framework</strong>. It&#8217;s only being used here to stub out the fetch call, which would otherwise make a call to the server. ItÂ  also keeps the call synchronous and gives us a canned answer that we can later observe. It&#8217;s framework independent, so can be used with your favourite Javascript testing framework.
<h2>The Feature</h2>
[codesyntax lang=&#8221;javascript&#8221; tab_width=&#8221;1&#8221;]
<pre>var Xkcd = (function(){

	var ComicNavigator = Backbone.Model.extend({

			toLatest: function(){
				var comic = new Comic()
				var nav = this;
				comic.fetch({
					success: function(model){
						nav.set({"current": model});
						nav.set({"latest": model});
					}
				});
			}
		}
	);

	var Comic = Backbone.Model.extend({
		url: function(){
			return 'http://dynamic.xkcd.com/api-0/jsonp/comic/' + (this.id || "") + '?callback=?'
		},

		initialize: function(){
	    	this.backbone_fetch = this.fetch;
			this.fetch = function(options)
			{
				options || (options = {});
				options.jsonpCallback = 'comicIncoming';
				return this.backbone_fetch(options);
			}
		}
	});

	return {
		ComicNavigator: ComicNavigator,
		Comic: Comic
	};

})();</pre>
[/codesyntax]
<h3>So what&#8217;s going on?</h3>
First of all, I&#8217;m using the <strong><a href="http://www.addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#revealingmodulepatternjavascript">Revealing Module Pattern</a> to namespace the models</strong> into &#8216;Xkcd&#8217;. The return statement at the end is effectively publicly exposing the ComicNavigator and Comic. Anything I want to keep private I can, I just don&#8217;t expose it. This particular version of the <a href="http://www.addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript">Module Pattern</a> is quite neat as it clearly shows what&#8217;s public and you can use consistent function definitions regardless of whether the function is public or private.

<strong><a title="Backbone" href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a> is a lightweight MVC-like framework</strong> that allows you to structure your code, specifically separating your data from its presentation. I&#8217;m doing it an injustice, it actually does a lot more and is very useful in keeping everything in sync with a RESTful backend, not to mention routing, eventing and validation.

In the above example I have 2 models. The rest of the code uses <a title="Backbone Router" href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Router">routes</a> for bookmarking specific comics and possibly navigation to (I&#8217;ve yet to decide on that). There&#8217;s also a <a title="Backbone View" href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#View">view</a> which will bind to the current comic on the navigator. As the navigator changes the current comic the UI will automatically reflect this. You&#8217;ll be able to see all this in the finished app (coming soon!).

For the Comic model, Backbone has a <a title="Backbone Model fetch method" href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Model-fetch">fetch</a> method that will automatically populate the model, given a url. I&#8217;m overriding the url property in order to add a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">jsonp</a> callback (the XKCD service is on a different domain to the app). <strong>Just by adding &#8220;?callback=?&#8221; means backbone will switch to jsonp</strong>. Backbone just defers to jQuery&#8217;s $.ajax (or <a title="Zepto.JS" href="http://zeptojs.com/">Zeptos</a>) method, which automatically detects theÂ  presence of =? and switches from json to jsonp. If there&#8217;s no comic id the service returns the latest comic. I&#8217;m also intercepting the fetch function to specify &#8216;comicIncoming&#8217; as the callback, normally this isn&#8217;t necessary but the XKCD service doesn&#8217;t like jQuerys automatically generated callback.

At this stage, I&#8217;m not certain that the Navigator should be a Backbone model. It makes sense in a typical MVC app and has some characteristics of a Backbone model but then doesn&#8217;t have the persistence/entity behaviours.

I&#8217;m also not happy with the 1st spec, I think it&#8217;s highlighting a smell around newing up a comic. My static mind says inject a factory but that doesn&#8217;t feel right in a dynamic language. Thoughts?

What I&#8217;ve shown is a small slice of the app, to show off some of the techniques and tools. Clearly there&#8217;s more, I just haven&#8217;t written it yet. Once the app is complete, it will show how the other parts come into play, specifically the routes and the view.

  <div class="post__content">From the immortal words of Steve Krugs usability book <a href="http://www.sensible.com/dmmt.html">Don&#8217;t Make me Think</a>, Santander makes me think every time I have to login to their <a title="Santander Online Banking" href="https://retail.santander.co.uk/LOGSUK_NS_ENS/BtoChannelDriver.ssobto?dse_operationName=LOGON">online banking site</a>. So here&#8217;s a handy translation guide to what they&#8217;re really asking you to enter to login.
<h2>Step 1</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-611" title="Santander Login Screen 1" src="http://tomphilip.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Santander-Login-Screen-1.png" alt="First page for the Santander Online Banking Login" width="625" height="263" />
<h3><strong>Personal ID = Username</strong>.</h3>
Like what everybody else asks for and not to be confused with the other code/id they give you, the Registration Number (see step 2).
<h2>Step 2</h2>

<h3><strong>Passcode = Password</strong>.</h3>
&nbsp;

Beyond just the bad labelling, the Back and Submit buttons are the same. I have to read each one to know what to click. What&#8217;s up with &#8216;login&#8217; or &#8216;signin&#8217;? What am I submitting?

Nice friendly memorable url too, well done. <a href="https://retail.santander.co.uk/LOGSUK_NS_ENS/BtoChannelDriver.ssobto?dse_operationName=LOGON">https://retail.santander.co.uk/LOGSUK_NS_ENS/BtoChannelDriver.ssobto?dse_operationName=LOGON</a>

What it is and how you can use it with Lean Startup and Customer Development. With my fear of public speaking and man flu on top of it, I bumbled through the talk. So I do recommend you read the book <a title="Business Model Generation Book" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Business-Model-Generation-Visionaries-Challengers/dp/0470876417/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323438500&amp;sr=8-1">Business Model Generation</a>, if my talk was incoherrent.

<a title="Producteev" href="http://producteev.com">Producteev</a> for Mac is a beautifully designed task list app, that&#8217;s a pure joy to use. You can&#8217;t help but feel that every little piece has been well thought out and designed. It uses contrast and colour to good effect, adding to its looks and helping the user to interact with and visualise tasks.

Adding new tasks is easy. Called up with a hotkey from within any app. It allows extra options (labelling, deadlines, starring etc) to be set too without it being an unwieldy dialog.

Task organisation is easy too, by clicking on the obvious icons to pop-up simple focused dialogs for each property of a task you wish to set (see Setting a Deadline screenshot).

<a title="GTD App Review â Astrid" href="http://tomphilip.me/index.php/gtd-app-review-astrid/">Astrid</a> would be the Android client in this trusted system but if their soon to be released Android app is anywhere as good as its Mac app, then I can&#8217;t wait to see that.

I put <em>no</em> for contexts/tags but you can assign multiple labels to task, so labels could be used for both projects and contexts. Not as nice as separate but a workaround. Another approach is to use Workspaces as projects and labels as contexts. The problem with this is labels belong to a workspace, so it wouldn&#8217;t be possible to see all tasks for a certain context. Also Google Calendar integration is per workspace, so for each workspace you&#8217;d get a separate calendar and need to connect this to Google. Â  <strong>I&#8217;d be interested to here from anyone who&#8217;s using/tried either approach and the pros/cons of each.</strong>
<h2>Downsides</h2>
Labels not having the option to span Workspaces.

Having to manually connect each workspace to Google Calendar, thus creating a calendar in Google Calendar per workspace.
<h2>Puzzling</h2>
After 5 labels, you need to expand to see the rest of them (see &#8216;Moving House&#8217; in the Main Screen screenshot). Shame it just doesn&#8217;t show them all or allow you to choose how many to show, there&#8217;s space.

<strong>Update 12/9/2012</strong> - You can actually manually order the lists, by dragging and dropping them into the top half (above the <em>more</em>). So this puzzler goes away.

Dock badges just seem to be for tasks that you&#8217;ve assigned to others or have has assigned to you (I didn&#8217;t get to verify this with someone, so this is I&#8217;m assuming where dock badges come in). I was expecting to get badges for overdue tasks.
<h2>Useful Extras</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Import tasks from Remember the Milk.</li>
	<li>Multiple notes per task.</li>
	<li>Attach a file with each note. Multiple notes mean you can attach multiple files. 100mb file storage limit for free accounts.</li>
	<li>Workspaces for top level partitioning of tasks. Eg Work, Home etc.</li>
	<li>Enhanced for OSX Lion.</li>
	<li>Global hot key to bring up new task box.</li>
	<li>Audit trail. So you can see the history of what&#8217;s happened to a task.</li>
	<li>Assign tasks to other people.</li>
	<li>Collaborate on Workspaces.</li>
	<li>You can create your own filters using quite an extensive criteria and remove the default ones to.</li>
	<li>Smart task entry. Eg ** walk the dog tomorrow, adds a task with 2 stars and a deadline of tomorrow</li>
	<li>All items (labels and Filters) in the left menu can be dragged and dropped to re-order them.</li>

<a href="http://astrid.com">Astrid</a> is <strong>popular task list app for Android</strong>, that is easy to use and comes with a <strong>host of syncing options</strong>. Incredibly simple and straight forward to use with a pleasant <strong>clean UI</strong>.

It stands out from other task list apps, with some unique features such as backups, random notifications for overdue tasks and encouragements.

Used with Producteev syncing, means I can use the Producteev Mac app as the desktop client for my GTD system. That review is coming soon.

<h2>Downsides</h2>
It&#8217;s an impressive app but the lack of GTD specific folders and contexts/tags, means it loses out to those that have them. They of course can be replicated with lists (tasks can belong to more than one list).

You can&#8217;t add a task from the lists home page and you can&#8217;t set the lists page as your <em>home screen</em>.

You can&#8217;t remove or customise the default filters. Like &#8216;Recently Modified&#8217; which doesn&#8217;t feel like a useful filter.
<h2>Puzzling</h2>
Nothing puzzling, just a straight forward task list app.
<h2>Useful Extras</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Time how long it takes to perform a task.</li>
	<li>Workspaces for top level partitioning of tasks. Eg Work, Home etc. When used with Producteev sync.</li>
	<li>Assign tasks to other people and collaborate on lists too.</li>
	<li>Randomly <del>remind</del> nag you of overdue tasks.</li>
	<li>Limited smart task entry. Eg add to list #listname would add the task to <em>listname</em></li>
	<li>Power packs for more widgets, notifications based on location and voice integration.</li>
	<li>Widget for any list/view of tasks.</li>
	<li>Add limited filters.</li>
	<li>Reminders come with encouragements to complete overdue tasks and a host of other reminder settings.</li>

<a href="http://www.wunderlist.com/">Wunderlist</a> is a beautiful looking free app that is unbelievably simple to use. Providing that same experience across all the major platforms and devices. There&#8217;s no need to re-learn or adapt for which platform you&#8217;re on.

It lacks some GTD-esque features but what it does with the features it has, it does very well. It has a lot of potential for a GTD system, should they take note of the <a href="http://wunderlist.uservoice.com/forums/136230-general/filters/top">top most requested features</a>. It also looks like <a href="http://www.wunderkit.com/hAWLdo">Wunderkit</a>, a kind of Wunderlist Pro, is just round the corner which looks like it could be the real GTD deal. Looking forward to seeing that (hint hint).

One little thing I did notice that stood out above all Android apps I use (non task management apps included) is the lack of add button next to where you add a task (No matter what app you use to add something, there&#8217;s an add button next to it). You simply tap &#8216;done&#8217; on the keyboard and the task gets added. It&#8217;s a nice little touch, as your fingers are already on the keyboard.

If you&#8217;ve tried the Android app before and had a terrible time of it, they have released a native Android which is quicker and reliable.

<h2>Downsides</h2>
It doesn&#8217;t do anything badly, it just lacks some of the features required for a good GTD system. Besides the shortage of features there&#8217;s little wrong with this app. With the features it has, it performs them with beauty and ease.
<h2>Puzzling</h2>
You can set reminders on the Android version but not the Mac or Web versions.

The sync button/notification can often says it&#8217;sÂ  failed (goes red) but then syncs again and all is OK (goes green).
<h2>Useful Extras</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The app is <a href="https://github.com/6wunderkinder/wunderlist">open source</a></li>
	<li>Smart task adding. Eg Include a * to add a starred task. Include the word &#8216;tomorrow&#8217; to add a task due tomorrow.</li>
	<li>Choice of app backgrounds. The wood is my favourite.</li>
	<li>You can share individual lists with people to collaborate on.</li>
	<li>You can share all your lists on <a href="http://getcloudapp.com/">CloudApp</a> and then give anyone the secret url.</li>
	<li>You can show all tasks (or starred ones or completed ones) on one screen grouped by list.</li>
	<li>Overdue tasks appear as a badge on the dock icon</li>
</ul>

<a href="http://www.doit.im">Doit.im</a> is a fantastic multi-platform free service, designed specifically for GTD. It has a pleasant simplicity about it, that looks great and makes it easy to use.

Because it is <a href="https://i.doit.im/features">made for GTD</a>, it isn&#8217;t bloated with features and focuses on the key principles of GTD. It has GTD specific lists (Eg someday, next, waiting for etc), filters which make sense (eg contexts, projects etc) and an ever present &#8216;Create Task&#8217; button for collecting those thoughts. All of which help you through the <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/gtd-workflow-chart.html">GTD process</a>.

<h2>Downsides</h2>
From the web app, it&#8217;s quite often slow to perform tasks.

The Mini app for Mac, is in need of an update. Key functionality is missing (see puzzling) and missing also are tags, contexts, priorities, recurrences and a project view.

Because of the layout (in web app) I can&#8217;t &#8216;sit&#8217; in the inbox and organise tasks into projects via drag and drop.

Shame it only has task counts for some of its lists (Inbox and Today) and not the others.
<h2>Puzzling</h2>
The mini app is totally unaware of the statues of Tomorrow, Next and Waiting For. Setting a task to any of these doesn&#8217;t sync that change to the mini app therefore showing the task to have the wrong status. Any tasks added with these statuses don&#8217;t even show up in the mini app after a sync, not that there is a way to see a view of these lists anyway.
<h2>Useful Extras</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Projects or special lists can be set as the first screen to open when the app starts up (Android).</li>
	<li>Calendar and list widgets (Android).</li>
	<li>Assign tasks to other people.</li>
	<li>Special lists specific to GTD, such as Next, Scheduled, Waiting for, Someday</li>
	<li>Smart add, so you can add tasks with details. Eg Buy FlourÂ  #Bake a cake ^Someday, would put task into &#8216;Bake a cake&#8217; project and classify as &#8216;someday maybe&#8217;.</li>
	<li>You can create your own filters, based on an extensive criteria and add these to the menu underneath the special lists.</li>
	<li>Global hot key to bring up new task box (Mac Mini).</li>
</ul>

<a href="http://www.toodledo.com">Toodledo</a> is an extremely feature rich web app but unfortunately this is also its falldown. The UI is complicated and not pleasant to use. However it is very reasonably priced.

This large number of features does have a silver lining. Toodledo allows third-party developers to create apps using its API. Apps can be created which aren&#8217;t constrained by lack of meta-data about a task or features. The apps can then provide a simplified pleasant UI. This has already happened with <a title="GTD App Review â Due Today" href="http://tomphilip.me/index.php/gtd-app-review-due-today/">Due Today</a> and <a title="GTD App Review â TODO for Mac" href="http://tomphilip.me/index.php/gtd-app-review-todo-for-mac/">TODO for Mac</a>. Both have a great user experience. With over <a href="http://www.toodledo.com/tools/directory.php">third-party 50 apps</a>, there&#8217;s already plenty of choice.

<h2>Downsides</h2>
The poor user experience. It&#8217;s trying to be something to everybody, which is making it difficult to use. There&#8217;s very little that is good about the UI. It&#8217;s busy, lacks contrast, cramped, small, confusing, inconsistent, baffling. I&#8217;ll stop there, you can probably guess I don&#8217;t like it.

<del>There&#8217;s no task count to show how many tasks are in a folder/list.</del> <strong>UPDATE</strong> mhm08 (from GTD forum) pointed out that this a setting you need to turn on.

Lack of drag and drop, means organising tasks is done by editing each one individually.
<h2>Puzzling</h2>
The UI.
<h2>Useful Extras</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Loads of integration with other services. Eg Twitter, email, rss, Firefox and <a href="http://www.toodledo.com/tools/index.php">more</a>.</li>
	<li>Share your list with other people, for reading or adding/editing.</li>
	<li>Tasks can be assigned to goals, so you can track whether you are meeting your high level life goals.</li>
	<li>Stats for tracking progress. Linked to goals too.</li>
	<li>A range of ways to <a href="http://www.toodledo.com/tools/import_export.php">import your tasks</a>.</li>
	<li>Attach files to tasks.</li>
	<li>Specify defaults for tasks.</li>
	<li>Configurable &#8216;hotlist&#8217;, for tasks that have some kind of urgency.</li>

<a href="http://www.appigo.com/todo/mac">TODO for Mac</a> is a great little app, that has impressive number of features whilst still managing to be easy to use. It meets all criteria I set out. It&#8217;s fairly easy on the eye and didn&#8217;t require me to think how to use it. It&#8217;s also a native Mac app (ie no Adobe Air or Titanium) and so fits in with the look and feel of your other Mac apps.

Adding new tasks is a snap with the quick entry box, which can be called up when you&#8217;re in any app with a hotkey. Organising tasks, is a simple drag and drop affair. Plus the calendar offers a nice way to drag and drop tasks to be scheduled.

<h2>Downsides</h2>
The only place it fell down was the user experience. With having to double-click to open the edit details, the list jumping about because it&#8217;s expanded and textboxes that jumped out and close button being at the other side of the screen. All this made the editing of task a bit of a jarring experience. The overall feel of the app is very functional and lacks colour or contrast.
<h2>Puzzling</h2>
Items added by quick task entry don&#8217;t appear at the top (or bottom) of the inbox list. They seemed to appear randomly in the list, which is a pain when looking for an item just added.
<h2>Useful Extras</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Growl notifications</li>
	<li>Global hot key to bring up new task box</li>
	<li>Badge for dock icon overdue items</li>
	<li>You can specify a type of task. Like email xyz@tom.com. You then get an email icon next too the task. Click on it open up an email to that person. <strong>Neat</strong>. Others are visit a location, sms somebody, call somebody, visit a url.</li>
	<li>There&#8217;s a calendar in the bottom right that you can drag tasks onto, to set a deadline</li>
	<li>Enhanced for OSX Lion</li>
	<li>Grouping items by &#8216;overdue&#8217;, &#8216;Next 7 days&#8217;, &#8216;No Due date&#8217;, &#8216;Completed&#8217;</li>
	<li>I like how it shows the number of tasks vs those that are overdue in a split task number box. It&#8217;s a nice design touch that gets the message across really well.</li>

<p><a href="http://www.lakeridgesoftware.com/products/android/DueToday/">Due Today</a> is <strong>great looking app</strong>, that is <strong>easy to navigate and manage tasks on a small screen</strong>. Each task is highly configurable with many properties to tweak (or not, if you turn them off). Yet when viewing a list of tasks it makes great use of colour, contrast and icons to visually communicate all that information about a task, without it feeling cramped or overwhelming.</p>

<p>It has large number of filtering options and special folders that allow to splice and dice your tasks in anyway you see fit.</p>

<p>The add task button is always at hand to add any tasks that come to mind, no matter which list your in.</p>

<h2>Downsides</h2>
<p>See puzzling.</p>

<h2>Puzzling</h2>
<p>Floating tasks? I was very confused about what this setting was on a task and never got to figure it out. Setting it on a task in the inbox took it out of the inbox, was all I could learn.</p>

<p>Some tasks that had tags in Toodledo, showed that they had tags (with a tag icon next to it) but when opened didn&#8217;t show any.</p>

<p>Tasks that didn&#8217;t have due dates would show up in the special Today folder.</p>

<p>The difference between Today and Next special folders, is confusing. They both appear to contain almost the same tasks, so not sure what it decides goes into these folders. This is how I would have thought they should behave:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Today - tasks with due dates that are overdue or are due today.</li>
	<li>Future - tasks with due dates for later than today.</li>
	<li>Next - tasks that have no due date set.</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#8217;s my interpretation of GTD. Is that how you see it?</p>

<h2>Useful Extras</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Projects can be pinned to the home screen</li>
	<li>I like how it shows the number of tasks vs those that are overdue in a split task number box. It&#8217;s a nice design touch that gets the message across really well. Does the same in 1x1 widget too.</li>
	<li>Lots of reminder options. LED colours, vibrate, ringtone.</li>
	<li>Out of the box the default settings are just fine but if you want to tweak it, it has a host of options you can set to make it your own. Too many to mentions here. Everything from &#8216;which side the checkboxes should appear&#8217; to &#8216;which screen should be the home screen&#8217;.</li>
	<li>A widget, in the paid version.</li>
	<li>Defaults for tasks that go into a project. Eg For a project &#8216;Spring Clean&#8217; the default context @home</li>
	<li>Long hold the Android search button to add tasks directly into Due Today, no matter whereÂ  you are in Android. Like a global hotkey, neat idea.</li>
	<li>Assign tasks to other people.</li>
</ul>

    <h1 class="post__title"><a href="/gtd-app-review-introduction/">GTD App Review - Who and What</a></h1>

  </header>

  <div class="post__content"><p>
  <img alt="GTD Process" src="/images/uploads/2011/09/GTD-Process.jpg">
</p>

<p>
  <a title="Getting Things Done" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">GTD</a> owns me.
  I&#8217;m forgetful, not your average forgetful, I&#8217;m forget your Mums birthday forgetful (twice running, ouch!).
  So when I discovered GTD over 3 years ago, it changed my life. Like having kids. Now I&#8217;m anal about capturing everything,
  nothings escapes the system. My <a title="Mind Like Water" href="http://zenhabits.net/mind-like-water/">mind is like water</a>,
  my tasks are in a trusted system, not my sieve head. I&#8217;d be lost without it and now I never forget (well *I do* but my system doesn&#8217;t).
</p>

<p>
  Ever since moving from Windows to Mac,
  I&#8217;ve been on the <strong>lookout for a new GTD app</strong> to replace my old Windows
  <a title="My Life Organized" href="http://www.mylifeorganized.net/">MLO</a> app.
  There&#8217;s hundreds of apps out there and I&#8217;ve been taking a brief look at them, to come up with a shortlist of potential apps.
  I&#8217;m then going to review each shortlisted app, so I can pick an app for my trusted GTD system.
</p>

<p>
  This was going to be just one post but I soon realised that it would be a very long post and one
  I&#8217;d never get round to finishing, so I&#8217;ve split it into a series of posts.
  The series will consist of a post for each app review and a final round up, where I&#8217;ll announce my chosen app, the winner.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
  So the trusted system work for me, both technically and personally,
  I used these &#8216;must haves&#8217; to draw up the shortlist from the hundreds of apps.
</p>

<h3>Multi Device - Mac, Android and Windows</h3>
<p>a Mac, My phone is Android and I sometimes use Windows. A GTD offering would need to be available to all of these.</p>

<h3>Quick</h3>
<p>Seen as I was going to use this app everyday, effectively emptying my head into it.
  I need to capture, organise and review tasks quickly. For me this means native apps,
  not Web based. Web based can be quick but not when there&#8217;s no or little connectivity.
</p>

<h3>Available Offline with Cloud Syncing</h3>
<p>In order to capture tasks at anytime and anywhere, I need an app to work offline. This reinforces the need for native apps for Android and Mac. Web access would be sufficient for the occasional use on Windows.</p>

<h3>Beautiful</h3>
<p>As I&#8217;m going to be using this everyday, I wanted something that would look beautiful (I&#8217;ve now got a Mac don&#8217;t you know!). So any apps that looked like they&#8217;d been written in <a href="http://www.visualbasic6class.com/createform.html">VB4</a> or made in <a href="http://www.frontpage-templates.org/website-template-5.htm">frontpage</a>, got the boot.</p>

<h2>The Shortlist</h2>
<p>These are the apps that met the above prerequisites and the ones that I&#8217;m going to review in more detail.</p>

<h2><a name="criteria"></a>The Criteria</h2>
<p>This is the list of things, which I think makes a great GTD app and compliments how I manage my GTD system. I&#8217;ll review each app against this criteria in this series. <strong>Anything I&#8217;ve missed?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Great user experience</strong>. As I mentioned earlier, I will use this app heavily so it has to be an enjoyable experience.</li>
	<li><strong>Quick add</strong>. Preferably into a inbox for collecting.</li>
	<li><strong>Projects/Sub-tasks</strong>. For multi step actions.</li>
	<li><strong>Contexts/tags</strong>. Tagging tasks that can be completed at a certain place or circumstance. Eg @home, @phone, @internet.</li>
	<li><strong>Order tasks</strong>. Quickly drag &amp; drop tasks for next action to take in a project or other list.</li>
	<li><strong>Notes</strong>. To add more detail to a task.</li>
	<li><strong>Highlight/star</strong>. Nice to be able to star certain important tasks, so I can see just important tasks in one list.</li>
	<li><strong>Search</strong>. Quickly find a task!</li>
	<li><strong>Deadline</strong>. Setting deadlines for critical tasks. Pay the tax man, birthdays etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Reminder</strong>. Notify &#8216;X&#8217; days before a tasks deadline, so I can begin the task and complete it by then.</li>
	<li><strong>Recurring Tasks</strong>. For tasks that occur at the same time every month or year. Eg send monthly accounts</li>
	<li><strong>Sync with Google Calendar</strong>. I like to keep birthdays, events in this calendar and have a nice Android widget. So it&#8217;d be nice if task with a deadline turned up here too.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you think I&#8217;ve missed an app, let me know in the comments.</strong> Maybe I&#8217;ve already considered it and I thought it didn&#8217;t meet the prerequisites. Maybe I missed it completely, if so I might have time to include it in the series.</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean Startup</a> is all about learning and that&#8217;s certainly what I got out of this. 
  This article is about what I learnt and to let you know about the future of Laters. 
  It leads on from the first article <a title="Lean Startup on a Mobile Phone" href="/lean-startup-on-a-mobile-phone/">Lean Startup on a mobile phone</a>, 
  where I explained my approach and outlined some of my fears.
</p>

<h2>Feature Not Yet Made AKA Feature Fake</h2>
<p>
  One of the core features (or non-features) of Laters was the &#8216;Feature Not Yet Made&#8217;. This is what they looked like.
</p>
<p>
  <img alt="Not Yet Made - Share Article" src="http://laters.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Not-Yet-Made-Share-Article-200x300.png">
</p>


<h3>My 1 Star Fear</h3>
<p>
  This was one of my biggest fears when it came to making an <a title="What is an MVP?" href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html">MVP</a> 
  Android app and one that Web sites/apps don&#8217;t experience. 
  It was people would one star the app and leave bad nonconstructive feedback because it was minimal. 
  At the same time providing no way to engage customers (Android Market comments are all one way). Surprisingly though, there was 
  <strong>no bad feedback left for the app in the Android Market because of &#8216;Feature Fakes&#8217; or missing features</strong>. 
  Feedback has been positive and currently it has a 4 star rating.
</p>

<h3>Measurements</h3>
<p>
  Here&#8217;s what I learnt from the data gathered from the Feature Fakes, 
  based on people attempting to use them. My initial guess was &#8216;share article&#8217; would be the most desired feature. 
  So I was surprised that demand for Night Mode (light font colour on a dark background) was almost 3 times higher. 
  Without this experiment I wouldn&#8217;t have known this and would have developed &#8216;share article&#8217;. 
  This outcome also contributed my thoughts for the Pivot.
</p>
<p>
  <img alt="Feature Fake Stats" src="http://laters.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Feature-Fake-Stats.png">
</p>


<h2>Gathering Feedback</h2>
<p>
  As well as analytics, I asked for feedback directly using this 
  <a title="Laters feedback forum" href="http://laters.userecho.com">feedback forum</a> 
  from <a href="http://userecho.com">UserEcho</a>. Although hundreds of visits where made to this online 
  feedback forum from the app, the amount of feedback was very low. Difficult to know exactly why but these would be by guesses:
  <ul>
  	<li>The feedback site does have a customised version for mobile screens</li>
  	<li>It&#8217;s not integrated into the app itself</li>
  	<li>Having to signin to leave feedback</li>
  	<li>People just don&#8217;t care enough about the app</li>
  	<li>Small phones and virtual keyboards don&#8217;t lend themselves well to providing textual feedback</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  For me I think if the feedback was more tightly integrated into the app.   
  So it was all contained in the app, just a case of tapping to vote and entering short piece of text to provide feedback. 
  Then maybe that would lower the barrier to peoples resistance to leaving feedback. One to build-measure-learn I think.
  Maybe there&#8217;s a product in this one alone!
</p>

<h2>The Pivot</h2>
<p>
  One of the things that did happen that really put this app on hold and has forced a pivot on me, 
  was the <a title="What to do with Laters, now the official Read it Later app has turned up" href="http://laters.mobi/index.php/so-what-to-do/">release of the official Read It Later app within a week of the initial Laters release</a>. 
  This forced me into making a decision, as to whether to continue developing the app or not. 
  I&#8217;ve decided I&#8217;m going to continue and I&#8217;m going to take it in a different direction. 
  Rather than try include other &#8216;later&#8217; services, like instapaper, youtube/vimeo watch it later etc. 
  I&#8217;m going to concentrate on it being great at doing just one thing, that is<strong> reading articles.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Features will optimised to allow customers to achieve this one simple goal. 
  Other features will become secondary and either be chopped or moved out of the way.
</p>

<p>
  I like the official app but I only use about half of the features and 
  I think sometimes the extra features get in the way of what I&#8217;m there to do, 
  <strong>read articles</strong>. 
  It would be <a title="Andrew Chen - Don't compete on features" href="http://andrewchenblog.com/2011/07/11/dont-compete-on-features/">unwise to compete on features</a>, 
  so this new vision will be a &#8216;back to basics&#8217;. By not competing on features and having less features I can:
  <ul>
  	<li>Differentiate my offering from the official app</li>
  	<li>Cut development costs</li>
  	<li>Sell the app cheaper than the official one</li>
  </ul>
  
  These combined, I hope, will allow the app to compete with official one. 
  Well that&#8217;s the new vision. I will now test my guesses and continue down the build-measure-learn loop. Let the experiments begin!
</p>

<p>
  Many thanks to those people who are using the app and have left feedback. 
  If you&#8217;ve got an Android phone, it&#8217;s here in the <a title="Laters in the Android Market" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.conker.laters.pro">Android Market</a>. 
  Give it a spin, provide some feedback and contribute to the experiment.

</p>

<p>
  Wordpress is a great free open-source blogging platform (that can be used as a CMS too), 
  that just keeps getting better and better. 
  With thousands of free plugins and themes it can be extended in an extraordinary amount of ways.
</p>

<p>
  I&#8217;ve setup many wordpress blogs for <a href="http://www.greatboxee.com/">Great Boxee</a>, 
  <a href="http://laters.mobi">Laters - Read it Later client for Android</a>, 
  <a href="http://postboxed.conkersoftware.co.uk">Postboxed - Postboxes nearby on Android</a>, 
  <a title="Contemporary artist based in Liverpool" href="http://www.peterphilip.co.uk">Peter Philip</a> 
  and of course <a href="http://tomphilip.me">this blog</a>. 
  So I thought it&#8217;s about time I wrote about how I set up Wordpress blogs. 
  How this setup has served me well and ensures I get the best experience for me and my visitors. 
  This is my essential guide to creating a blog or CMS with Wordpress.
</p>

<h2>Install Wordpress</h2>
<p>
  It goes without saying I <a title="Wordpress download" href="http://wordpress.org/download/">download Wordpress</a> 
  and follow the <a title="How to install Wordpress" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Famous_5-Minute_Install">famous 5-minute install guide</a> 
  to get the basic Wordpress up and running.
</p>


<p>
  This I always forget, <strong>set read permissions on the wp-content/uploads folder</strong> using your ftp program. 
  So UNIX permissions should show to be 775. If you don&#8217;t do this, your uploaded images don&#8217;t get served up.
</p>

<h2>Plugins</h2>
<p>
  These are the plugins I use to enhance my blog. There&#8217;s always similar competing ones but I&#8217;ve found these to 
  offer great functionality and be reliable. You can download them all from the official 
  <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">Wordpress plugin directory</a>. Unzip them and ftp them to your wp-content/plugins directory.

  <ul>
  	<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/akismet/"><strong>Akismet</strong> </a>- This great plugin stops all that spam appearing in your comments</li>
  	<li><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/">All in One SEO Pack</a> - </strong>Tweaks your pages for better SEO. Just works out of the box with fine-tuning for the not so lazy</li>

  	<li><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/feedburner-plugin/">FD Feedburner Plugin </a>- </strong>Put your feeds through feedburner for stats and email subscriptions</li>
  	<li><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/">Google Analytics for WordPress</a> - </strong>Easily plugin Google analytics to track usage of your blog</li>
  	<li><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/">Google XML Sitemaps</a> - </strong>Allow search engines to better index you blog</li>
  	<li><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/lightbox-2/">Lightbox 2</a> - </strong>Opens up thumbnailed or small images in a larger pretty dialog box</li>
  	<li>Some kind of social share links <strong><a title="Digg Digg Wordpress plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/digg-digg/">Digg Digg</a></strong>, is my current favourite. Digg Digg adds social sharing buttons with the counts to posts, pages etc</li>
  	<li><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/subscribe-to-comments/">Subscribe To Comments</a> - </strong>Allows commenters to subscribe to subsequent comments</li>
  	<li><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-for-wordpress/">Twitter for Wordpress</a> - </strong>Shows your twitter feed in your blog or <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-widget-pro/">Twitter Widget Pro</a> (has avatars)</li>

  	<li><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wptouch/">WPtouch</a> - </strong>Delivers a pretty phone friendly version of your blog optimised for mobile phone users</li>
  </ul>


  <ul>
  	<li><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/vimeo-quicktags/">Vimeo Quicktags</a> - </strong>Easily embed Vimeo videos in your posts</li>
  	<li><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-synhighlight/">WP-SynHighlight</a> - </strong>Prettifies your code so it looks like something you would see in your IDE</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Wordpress Settings</h2>
<p>
  Generally the defaults that Wordpress come with are good and can be left alone. The following will make it your own and improve on what&#8217;s there.

  <ul>
    <li><strong>General</strong> - add your sites tagline (default is &#8216;Just another Wordpress Site&#8217; which you don&#8217;t want)</li>
    <li><strong>Discussion</strong> - &#8216;Hold a comment in the queue if it contains&#8217; - change this to 1 link. Uncheck &#8216;Comment author must have a previously approved comment&#8217;. 
      I prefer to allow comments without approval. I get an email that a comments is there, so I can then go and act on it, if its inappropriate/spam. Akismet is on and posts with links need approval first.</li>
    <li><strong>Permalinks</strong> - Change it from the default which is not SEO or user friendly. I prefer a custom of &#8216;/index.php/%postname%/&#8217; simple and clean.</li>
    <li><strong>Posts </strong>- Delete the dummy post that come with Wordpress.</li>
    <li><strong>Create Author Account</strong> - Create myself an account (besides the admin account), under who I&#8217;ll publish posts as. The admin account normally has a strong generated obscure password that I could never remember, so my own account is just an editor with a password I can remember. 
      Make sure you change the &#8216;Display Name publicly as&#8217; to your name rather than some username/nickname.</li>
    <li><strong>Robots.txt</strong> - Create a <a href="http://boganmarketing.com/blog/ultimate-wordpress-robots-txt-for-silo-seo.html">robots.txt</a> file and ftp it to your root directory. This prevents search engines crawling private pages/scripts and indexing duplicates.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Plugin Settings</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Aksimet</strong> - Get an <a href="http://akismet.com/wordpress/">Akismet api key</a> and add it to the Akismet plugin</li>
    <li><strong>Twitter</strong> - Create twitter account (if needed) and put your twitter name in the Twitter plugin.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact Form</strong> - Create contact us page and add the contact form-7 tags/form to it. Send a test message through the form to make sure it&#8217;s working.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Analytics</strong> - Create a profile for the site in Google Analytics and add the tracking code to the analytics plugin.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Sitemaps</strong> - Add Yahoo ID to notify Yahoo of changes to content</li>
    <li><strong>WP-Touch</strong> - Tweak WP-Touch to your liking. There&#8217;s lots of options and the defaults are fine but you can change icons and colours etc if you like. Take a look in your phones browser to see how it looks.</li>
    <li><strong>Feedburner</strong> - Create an rss feed through feedburner and activate the feedburner widget with the feedburner url. This allows analytics and whole bunch of other benefits through feedburner, like subscribing to feeds by email, friendly web page to subscribe to your feed plus many more.</li>
    <li><strong>Digg Digg</strong> - Add your twitter name in the global options. Decide which social buttons to show, what to show them on (posts, pages, home etc) and where to position them. There&#8217;s too many services to show them all, so pick the well known ones.</li>
    <li><strong>All in one SEO</strong> - Enable and add values for home page. As you add post you can tweak the title, meta description and keywords.</li>
    <li><strong>Database Backup</strong> - Turn on scheduled back ups to be emailed to yourself.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Other</h2>
<p>
  
  These are also great enhancements worth applying.
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>About</strong> - Create an &#8216;About&#8217; page and fill it out. Let people know <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/about-pages-good-bad-and-missing/">who, where, what, how and when</a>.</li>
    <li><strong><a title="How to create a favicon for Wordpress" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_a_Favicon">Create an favicon icon</a></strong> for the site and ftp it to root (for rss readers) and to your themes root (for browsers). <a href="http://www.favicon.co.uk/">Favicon.co.uk</a> is really easy for this.</li>
    <li><strong>Monitor for uptime</strong>. I Use <a href="http://uptimerobot.com">Uptime Robot </a>which is easy on the eyes and has an array of methods to notify you when a site is down. And <a href="http://host-tracker.com/">Host Tracker</a> which checks your site from over a hundred nodes around the world</li>
    <li><strong>Feedback/Customer Service</strong> - If it&#8217;s an app/software blog - Setup <a href="http://uservoice.com">User Voice</a>/<a href="http://getsatisfaction.com">Get Satisfaction</a>/<a href="http://userecho.com">User Echo</a> or any customer service app for feedback and customer support.</li>
    <li><strong>What are people saying about it?</strong> - Setup google alerts to know when others mention your product/site.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  With over 15,000 plugins, Wordpress is extremely flexible and there is something for everyone. <strong>How do you setup yours?</strong>

    <h1 class="post__title"><a href="/lean-startup-on-a-mobile-phone/">Lean Startup on a Mobile Phone</a></h1>

  </header>

  <div class="post__content"><h2>How I Got Started</h2>
<p>
  When I started out with <a title="Laters for Android, Read it Later client" href="http://laters.mobi">Laters</a> 
  (an Android app for <a href="http://readitlaterlist.com/">Read it Later</a>), 
  it was a <a title="What's a Play Project?" href="http://www.screwworkletsplay.com/2010/10/the-power-of-a-play-project/">play project</a>, 
  it was something I developed on the tube on a small underpowered netbook to and from work. 
  I&#8217;d read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Startup">lean startups</a> 
  (much of it via Read it Later!) and <strong>it never occured to me that this could be applied to an Android app</strong>. 
  So I got a bit ahead of myself in terms of a 
  <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html">Minimal Viable Product</a> 
  (I realise now I could have released even earlier) but it forced me to release it early, rather then wait until feature rich, 
  so I could learn<strong> </strong>from this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a>.
</p>

<h2>My Fears</h2>
<p>
  Most written examples about Lean Startups revolve around the Web. So this is an experiment in itself, 
  to see if I could apply the techniques in an mobile phone app environment. 
  My biggest fear with a minimal app, is people will <strong>1 star it in the Android Market</strong> 
  and leave unhelpful comments like &#8220;Rubbish, does nothing&#8221;. 
  Thus putting off other people from installing it. 
  The Android Market is poor for constructive feedback, there&#8217;s no place to open up a dialog and find out 
  why it was rubbish and how it could be improved. There&#8217;s no way for someone to ask for something and get 
  notified that it&#8217;s now in the app. Community or social it&#8217;s not. 
</p>

<h2>How I&#8217;m doing it</h2>
<p>
  <img src="http://laters.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Build-Measure-Learn-245x300.png" alt="Build Measure Learn">
</p>

<h3>Build</h3>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve got my MVP. So my first release has <strong>just enough features, to make it usable</strong> 
  and allow me to learn what people would like from the app. My ideas (or guesses) 
  for cool features that haven&#8217;t been built but need verifying, come in the form of &#8216;Not Yet Made&#8217; feature dialogs.
</p>

<p>
  <img alt="Not Yet Made - Night Mode" src="http://laters.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Not-Yet-Made-Night-Mode-200x300.png">
  <img alt="Not Yet Made - Share Article" src="http://laters.mobi/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Not-Yet-Made-Share-Article-200x300.png">
</p>

<h3>Measure</h3>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve incorporated <a href="http://www.flurry.com">Flurry Analytics</a> to measure how people are using 
  the app and whether they are trying to use the <strong>&#8216;Not Yet Made&#8217; features</strong>. 
  In combination with those, I have links through to the <strong><a title="Feedback Forum - Suggest Features and Get Help" href="http://laters.userecho.com/">Feedback Forum</a></strong> 
  provided by <a href="http://www.userecho.com">UserEcho</a>. 
  Here people can discuss new features or problems and vote on features they would like. 
  <a href="https://market.android.com/">Android Market</a> gives me some feedback through comments, ratings and usage but this not very useful.
</p>

<p>
  I&#8217;m not sure I could apply <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing">split A/B testing</a>? Any thoughts?
</p>

<h3>Learn</h3>
<p>
  By taking the <strong>data from Analytics and the Feedback forum</strong>, 
  I should be able to decide which features to make, which to ditch and how current features are being used.
</p>

<p>
  I&#8217;m no lean startup expert. I&#8217;ve applied lean principles to software development in the past and 
  to this project but this was new for me. Another chance to learn, a 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development#Amplify_learning">core principle of Lean</a>. 
  So whether it&#8217;s actually lean startup, I&#8217;m not sure. I&#8217;d be interested to get some feedback from people who have some experience.
</p>

<p>
  If anyone would like to get involved, 
  <a title="Get Laters on your phone" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.conker.laters.pro">Laters is in the Android Market</a>. 
  Give your feedback and shape the app. Atypically I&#8217;ll be moving through the build-measure-learn loop quickly, 
  so expect some cool stuff on the way. An impending baby might put the brakes on this but bear with me and 
  I&#8217;m sure lack of sleep will mean nothing to me and I&#8217;ll back making those features.

  What else is a programmer/geek to do when he&#8217;s just moved house,

  Set up his own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a> board!

  This is a simple script that turns the <strong>TeamCity</strong> overview page <strong>green if all is good</strong> 
  and a nice<strong> red if any builds are broken</strong>.

  We have a nice big 57&#8221; LCD <a href="http://www.agileadvice.com/archives/2005/05/information_rad.html">information radiator</a>

  Gave a talk about <strong>BDD </strong>to the guys at work, about how we use it and could do more of it. 
  <strong>Not Business Driven Development</strong>, as I&#8217;d got into my head and kept referring to it as. 
  It was a bit embarrassing when, towards the end, somebody said that they&#8217;d heard about something like this called <strong>Behaviour Driven Development</strong>.

  </header>

  <div class="post__content"><p>
  <img src="/images/uploads/2011/09/couchdb.jpg" alt="CouchDB Logo">
</p>

<p>
  Giving <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> a spin was an experience that was way <strong>too easy</strong>. 
  The hardest part installing CouchDB was probably unzipping the files. This is how it went on Windows PC:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Download from here: <a title="Download CouchDB for Windows" href="http://www.couchone.com/get#win">http://www.couchone.com/get#win</a></li>
	<li>Unzip the files</li>
	<li>Run bin\couchdb.bat from the unzipped location</li>
	<li>There isn&#8217;t one, that&#8217;s it</li>
</ol>

<p>
  I then pointed my browser at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils">http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils</a> and I got this, CouchDBs admin, 
  <strong>Futon</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  <figure>
    <a href="/images/uploads/2011/07/Futon.png" class="swipebox" title="Futon"><img src="/images/uploads/2011/07/Futon.png" alt="Futon Screenshot"></a>
    <figcaption>click image to see full size image</figcaption>
  </figure>

</p>

<p>
  The Futon UX was a dream. It&#8217;s slick, every action is simple, you&#8217;re never lost, it looks great and is sprinked with a little humour (check out the &#8216;Admin Party&#8217;). 
  It even comes with it own set of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing#Smoke_testing_in_software_development">smoke tests</a>, 
  that you can run with ease from within Futon with a simple click. How cool is that.  
</p>

<p>
And then once you use it, it couldn&#8217;t be simpler. A RESTful JSON api over http.
</p>

<p>
  First impressions are important and CouchDB has left a great one. It&#8217;s still early days but may the love affair blossom.
